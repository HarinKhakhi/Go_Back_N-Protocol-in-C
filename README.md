Implementing go back n protcol of compuer networks in C language. 

# How to Use
First start the server_goback.c file by giving port number as a argument.
Then start the client_goback.c file by giving ip address of server and prot number as arguments, in different terminal.
Note : when running server and client on same machine give ip address of server : "127.0.0.1" which is local host.

Now enter a file name in client, if file exist in folder then server will send the file using go back n protocol.
else server will send error packet.
